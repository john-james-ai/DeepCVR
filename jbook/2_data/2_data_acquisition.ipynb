Statistical inference, predictive analytics, and problem solving with machines and math require data, in the right format, volume, and veracity. In this section, we design, build and execute a simple, automated and reproducible data ingestion pipeline that extracts the data from its source, transforms it into a usable and reliable resource, then loads the data into a database for downstream analysis and modeling.

    "The CoreData datasets map to an Impressions table, and a CoreFeatures table. The Impressions table has all the fields contained in the CoreData datasets with one exception: the feature list. Feature lists found in the CoreData and CommonFeaturesData datasets are variable length lists of feature structures, each containing a feature name, feature id, and feature value.

    "### Directed Acyclic Graph \n",
    "We've described the ETL process as a pipeline through which data flows sequentially from one end to the other. In practice, the metaphor is a bit misleading. Data isn't literally flowing from one end of a single tube to the other. Rather, ETL processes may be complex, non-linear, networks, of objects, tasks performed on those objects, and dependencies between tasks. A more apt theoretical framework for reasoning about ETL workflows can be borrowed from graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a pair $G=(V,E)$, where: \n",
    "- $V$ is a set of vertices, and \n",
    "- $E$ is a set of paired vertices or edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a *directed* graph or *digraph*, each edge $E \\subseteq \\{(x,y)|(x,y)\\in V^2$ and $x\\ne y\\}$ between a pair of vertices has a polarity or orientation from one vertex to another. For instance, the pair of vertices may be tasks to perform within a data pipeline, and the edge between them may represent the constraint that the end task must initiate after the start task has completed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A *path* graph is a sequence of edges in a graph in which the ending vertex or task of each edge in a sequence is the same as the starting vertex or task of the next edge in the sequence. More formally, a graph of order $n\\ge2$ is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order $\\{v_1,v_2,\\dots,v_n\\}$ such that the edges are $\\{v_i,v_{i+1}\\}$ for  $i=1,2,\\dots,n-1$. When the starting vertex of the path is the same as the ending vertex of the path, a cycle has been formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a directed *acyclic* graph has at least one topological ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that the start vertex of every directed edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of that edge. Further, any graph that has topological ordering cannot have any cycles because the edge into the earliest vertex of the cycle would have to be oriented in the wrong direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, graph theory provides a powerfully, simple and mathematically elegant language for  for expressing    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given their mathematical properties, DAGs have been used in a wide range of scientific, computational, biological, and sociological applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can represent our ETL process as a directed acyclic graph $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of objects or vertices, and $E$ is the set edges or tasks directionally connecting objects. The high-level ETL DAG is summarized in {ref}`etl_dag`.\n",
