    "## Dataset Organization\n",
    "The data are split into a training set and a corresponding test set. Each dataset is composed of two CSV formatted files: one which includes the labels and feature structures, and a second that captures features most common among the impressions. A completed sample contains both the label and core features, as well as the corresponding record from the common features file. The following summarizes the dataset statistics.\n",

    " - [Section 2.2](section_22_data_acquisition) **Data Acquisition**: The data are extracted, stored, and subsampled downstream analysis.    \n",
    " - [Section 2.3](section_23_data_profile) **Data Profiling**: Evaluation of the structure, quality and suitability of the data for the purpose. This high-level overview will examine data completeness, data classification, format, and properties of the data values. \n",
    " - [Section 2.4](section_24_data_preprocessing) **Data Processing**: Structure, format, and scale will be addressed during the data processing section. Transformation, encoding, and filtering activities will ensure that the dataset is suitable for exploratory analysis. \n",
    " -  [Section 2.5](section_25_eda) **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We aim to maximize insight into the dataset, uncover its underlying structure, extract important variables, detect outliers and anomalies, and gain insight.\n",
